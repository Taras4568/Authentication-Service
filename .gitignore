# Django specific
# Don't ignore migrations unless you have a specific reason and understand the implications.
# Migrations are typically tracked in version control.
# However, if you are generating them locally and want to exclude them from commits
# (which is generally discouraged), you might add:
# */migrations/*.py
# But do so with caution and clear team communication.
